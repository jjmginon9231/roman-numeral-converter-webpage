## Overview

This project is a Roman Numeral Converter Webpage, created as part of my journey through freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification. The layout is inspired by my previous Palindrome Checker Webpage and incorporates a glassmorphism design.

## Features

- **Convert Numbers to Roman Numerals**: Input any integer and get its Roman numeral equivalent.
- **Responsive Design**: The webpage is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.
- **Glassmorphism Design**: The interface uses a glassmorphism effect for a modern and sleek look.
- **Optimized Performance**: JavaScript code is minified for better performance.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling, including the glassmorphism effect.
- **JavaScript**: For the conversion logic and interactivity.

## Code Highlights

- **Conversion Logic**: Utilizes `if...else` statements to handle the conversion from integers to Roman numerals.
- **Minified JavaScript**: The JavaScript code is minified to enhance performance by reducing file size and load times.

## How to Use

1. **Input a Number**: Enter an integer in the input field.
2. **Convert**: Click the "Convert" button to see the Roman numeral equivalent.
3. **Responsive Design**: Enjoy the responsive design on any device.

## Inspiration

- **freeCodeCamp**: The core logic is based on the Roman Numeral Converter project from [freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/).
- **Palindrome Checker Webpage**: The layout and design are inspired by my previous project, the [Palindrome Checker Webpage](https://palindrome-checker-webpage.netlify.app/).
- **Glassmorphism**: The design incorporates glassmorphism for a modern and visually appealing interface.
